# 64 Districts of BD - Learn your districts

**Modules**
: *turtle, pandas*\
Python comes with turtle installed usually but install pandas/turtle module using
> pip install pandas\
> pip install turtle

**Game mechanics**:\
Enter the name of a district in the pop-up box. If the name is correct, it will
apeear on the map. If it isn't correct then nothing appears. The correct district
counter can be found on the pop-up box title.\
If the user types 'exit' then the game ends and a csv file of districts missed
is added in the folder to learn the missed districts.\

**Possible improvements In The Future**:
- Automated dependencies installation to make a better user experience
- Better text placement on the map
- Maybe detailed information about the district when clicked on it
- Add Bangla language since some of the spellings are off in English
- A web-based version

**Instructions to run**\
Install the pandas and turtle packages first using the method mentioned.
Next download the repository and in terminal just run using the commmand:
`python '<file_path>/main.py'` in the terminal. Make sure you have python installed
or it will not work.\
