The snippet below shows the compile and run steps of the project code. The `javac` 
compiler performs the compilation step, and `java` runs the file containing the main method, with 'infix_expr_short.txt'
and 'my_answer.txt' being the input and output files for the calculator program respectively. Finally, the 'fc.exe' utility compares the content of
'my_answer.txt` (my output) and `postfix_eval_short.txt` (expected output)
and reports that no differences were found in the two files.
